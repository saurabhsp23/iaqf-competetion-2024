# IAQF 2024 

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of Market-Based Probability Densities (MPDs) to
forecast financial market trends, particularly focusing on volatility and market reversals. We
employ a comprehensive dual-method approach, integrating both unconditional and
conditional assessments, to evaluate MPDs' enhancement of time-series models and their
application in empirical trading strategies. Our investigation covers two primary strategies: a
multi-factor trading strategy that combines advanced machine learning with traditional
statistical models, and a pair trading strategy that leverages MPD data for market exposure
mitigation and efficacy enhancement. Preliminary results reveal the variable effectiveness of
MPDs across different asset classes, demonstrating their potential to navigate complex market
dynamics and improve investment outcomes when appropriately integrated into trading
strategies.
